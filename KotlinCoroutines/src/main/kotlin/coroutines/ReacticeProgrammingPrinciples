What is Reactive Programming?
- A paradigm based on functional programming in which we model our logic as a set of operations in a data stream.
Reactive programming is largely based on observing some data, and performing some operations based on the data returned.

Reactive programming essentially is just relying on asynchronous programming to complete tasks and deliver information
to otherwise static content.

Four principles:
- Responsive: ensuring a system is responsive or responds regularly
- Resilient: resilient to failures by way of: delegation, replication, containment and isolation.
- Elastic: stretches in response to work load; scalable.
- Message-Driven: communicating via asynchronous message passing. You can continue work while messages are passed.
