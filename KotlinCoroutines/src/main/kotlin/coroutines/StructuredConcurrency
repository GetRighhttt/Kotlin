What is Structured Concurrency?

- Structured Concurrency is essentially Coroutines have to be launched within a defined Coroutine Scope, which
creates a Coroutine hierarchy that follows a set of constraints and guidelines. It's when a parent coroutine
has child coroutines, and there are constraints that arise because of this. It basically encompasses the ideology
of Object Oriented Programming, but for asynchronous programming.

Here are the rules that constraints that arise when using Structured Concurrency:
A. Children inherit context from their parent;
B. If a child coroutine raises an error, the parent coroutine also has an error;
C. When a parent is canceled, it's children are also canceled; and
D. A parent coroutine suspends until all of its children have finished thier tasks.
