Why Coroutines?

Coroutines are one of the best ways to achieve asynchronous programming with minimal code and advanced code quality.
In Android, the main UI thread is responsible for updating the screen at a rate of 60 times per second.
So, because of this, we want to do all heavy operations on another thread, preferably a background thread. This
 is the concept of asynchronous programming, or programming tasks in parallel. Asynchronous programming allows a user
 to go about their task while other tasks are running in the background, and the current tasks will not be
 interrupted. Coroutines helps us achieve this and alleviates the pain of boilerplate code in the process.

A coroutine is essentially a lightweight thread that exists ON a background thread. One Coroutine represents a job
that it is doing, and that job can consists of various tasks.
With those tasks, you can "suspend" functions or methods to handle the tasks, which essentially suspends one task
to allow for another to complete while its doing its work. They are so lightweight that you can run thousands
at one time on one background thread. Because of this, we can chain these tasks in parallel which allows us to
complete numerous tasks at one time while not blocking the main UI thread.

Coroutines combine the simplicity of synchronous code with the complexity of asynchronous code.
This in essence, is why Coroutines are one of the most useful libraries in Android right now.
