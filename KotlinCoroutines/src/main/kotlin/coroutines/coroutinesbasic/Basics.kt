     * Coroutines follow the concept of Structured Concurrency, which essentially means that each coroutine
     * should be launched in a defined Coroutine Scope, which delimits the life of that coroutine. It helps to
     * prevent resource and memory leakage. This is why we use GlobalScope to launch this coroutine below.
     * Structured Concurrency = managed jobs. When something doesn't need to run anymore, it is killed automatically.
     *
     * An outer scope cannot complete until all the children have completed.
     *
     * Declaring a Coroutine which operates IN a background thread...
     *
     * launch, async, and runblocking are coroutine builders that essentially just create coroutines.
     * launch = standalone
     * async = deferred
     * runblocking = blocks the main
     *
     * Coroutines have scopes in which they launch their lightweight threads(Structured Concurrency):
     *
     * GlobalScope launches for the whole application lifetime.
     * Lifecycle launches and dies when the activity dies. (Activity/Fragment)
     * ViewModel launches and dies when the view-model is no longer needed.(ViewModels)
     * Coroutine wraps the given context. Allows you to create your own scope.
     *
     * In Android, we have launch, launchWhenStarted, launchWhenResumed, etc. and these allow us to further manage
     * our jobs.
