Coroutines were actually built with two separate libraries. One was the built-in library which demonstrates most of
tha language features under the hood, and the other is the kotlinx.library, which is what we typically use for
day-to-day operations and development. The built-in library is used primarily for those developers who build
libraries; those who aim to create libraries for other developers to use. Whereas the kotlinx.library is known for its
simplicity, and how it aims to achieve best practices and guidelines that align with current design patterns and
coding styles of today. It's essentially what we will primarily be using in Android development.
