Why Functional programming?

Functional programming has really emerged significantly recently and that is due to the
need for parallel code in our programs. We no longer can just increase CPU performance and speed,
so instead we have optimized functional programming and Kotlin does a fantastic job of this. The
functional programming paradigm is very good at parallelizing code.

Functional programming is seen more in declarative programming rather than imperative, which could also
contribute to the recent rise in usage from almost all the other languages in the world today.
