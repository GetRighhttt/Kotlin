There are 5 types of scope functions:
with, let, run, apply, and also.

There are only two ways to distinguish between the two:
1. The way to refer to the context object - either "this" or "it".
2. The return value is either - the context object, or the lambda result.

'with' - this, lambda result
'let' - it, lambda result
'run' - this, lambda result
'apply' - this, context object
'also' - it, context object

Scope functions main purpose are to make your code clear, concise, and more readable.
