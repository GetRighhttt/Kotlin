# Kotlin

## Repo to demo the Kotlin language and syntax.
#### The commented code in this repo is meant to inform.
#### I love Kotlin, and I believe there are a ton of functionalities in Kotlin that could tremendously reduce the time and complexity of Android projects.
#### Teach me everything you know, and I'll share what I know. I enjoy learning and discussing topics!
#### Enjoy and thanks for the support!

##### I continuously update this repo whenever there is some new information that I can upload, change, etc.
