1. Kotlin has complete null safety:
    a. Kotlin code won't compile if you want to access a method on a null object.
    b. Java usually has a ton of null pointer exception errors;
    c. Kotlin fixes this issue by allowing the ability for object to be declared
    as nullable;
    d. You prevent a ton of crashes by switching over to Kotlin.

2. Kotlin has the safe libraries as Java, so you can use the same methods in Kotlin
that you used in Java.

3. Kotlin has Coroutines, which aren't available for Java.
    a. Coroutines are lightweight threads that make it easy to delay or suspend your code,
    and improve your application performance.

4. Kotlin requires less code than Java.

5. Kotlin has data and sealed classes whereas Java does not, which makes it easier for
us to handle data.
