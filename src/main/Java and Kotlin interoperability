One of the great features about Kotlin is its interoperability. Interoperability essentially means
the ability to operate with other languages. In this case, we're talking about its ability to
operate with Java code. Kotlin and Java can operate simultaneously in one project, or you can add
Kotlin code to an already existing project that was programmed in Java, or you can convert a Java
project to Kotlin, and vice versa. It is very simple in Android Studio, or IntelliJ. How is this
possible? Java and Kotlin code both get decompiled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to byte code
that exists as .class files. Because the code of Kotlin and Java both decompile to the same byte
code, the languages can be used with one another, and not to mention the fact that Kotlin was built
on top of Java to begin with. In the industry, this is essentially how companies migrate their code
bases from preexisting technologies to modern tech.
