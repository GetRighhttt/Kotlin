What are Generics?

Generics - a feature that allow us to define classes, methods and properties which are accessible using different
data types while keeping a check on the compile-time type safety. Generics allow developers the ability to create
classes and methods that can be used by numerous data types, and also custom types. Generics aid in library and
framework creation, and are quite literally one of the most useful features of almost every programming language in
my personal opinion.

What is Variance?

Variance - a feature that allows for the specification of type parameters where they can be used in a very specific
context; it explains which context the generic type should be used in and for.

InVariant - can be consumed and produced
CoVariant(out) - can only be produced; used as a return type
ContraVariant(in) - can only be used as an input; used as a declaration only
