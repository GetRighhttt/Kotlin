/*
Abstract classes are classes that are meant to be inherited from and cannot be instantiated.
Think of them like interfaces but with the functionality of a class.

The difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that abstract classes can have everything interfaces can
have, but also they can have fields(private and protected properties), can have final methods, and constructors.

Abstract classes are sometimes called "incomplete classes" because cannot be instantiated, and act like an interface,
whereas an interface is referred to a template of a class.
