 * Item #1 - Limit Mutability
 *
 * Mutable states have  core problems:
 * a. Harder to understand and debug a program with many mutating points;
 * b. Mutability makes it harder to reason about code;
 * c. Mutable states require proper synchronization in multithreaded programs;
 * d. Mutable elements are harder to tests;
 * e. Other objects need to be notified when a state mutates.
