What is Idiomatic Kotlin?

Well first, what does Idiomatic and Idiom mean?
- Idiomatic: of, relating to, or conforming to idiom; peculiar to a particular group, individual, or style.
- Idiom: an expression in the usage of a language that is peculiar to itself either in having a meaning that
cannot be derived from the conjoined meanings of its elements or in its grammatically atypical use of words; the
language particular to a people or to a district, community, or class; the grammatical, syntactical, or
structural form to a peculiar language.

- Essentially, Idiomatic kotlin is using the Kotlin syntax and semantics to its full extent. Embodying all of Kotlin's
features and functionality to write more expressive, readable, and reusable code.
