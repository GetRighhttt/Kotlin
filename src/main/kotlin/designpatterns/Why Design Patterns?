Why Do we need Design Patterns and what are they?

- Design Patterns, first made notable by the "Gang of Four" a while ago, came about when some brilliant
software developers recognized common problems when developing code. The idea is this: all software engineers at
some point in their careers are going to face extremely similar, if not identical problems that all have similar,
or identical solutions. The solutions are design patterns. Well, what are design patterns? Design patterns are
proven solutions to reoccurring problems that developers face when designing software. These problems have been
observed and noticed over time, and these solutions have been tested and over and over again, and have proven to work.

When you think of Design patterns, think of a proven solution to a common problem. This also, doesn't just mean in
tech. Think of a sport, let's say basketball. Guys and girls play. However, they typically have different hand sizes due
to their genetic makeup. The normal basketball is sometimes too big for females players. What is the solution? Design a
smaller ball. Have two separate sizes. Walla. You just completed a design pattern. In this case, however, it was
a creational design pattern.

Design Patterns come in three main types:

Creational - how and when you create objects;
Structural - deals with the relationship between objects; and
Behavioral - deals with the behavior between objects, and how they interact with one another.
